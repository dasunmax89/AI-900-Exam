Main AI Workloads

Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
Computer vision - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
Natural language processing - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
Document intelligence - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
Knowledge mining - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
Generative AI - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

1.#############################################
Machine learning models try to capture the relationship between huge data data we create day to day
The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a model.

Machine learning in Microsoft Azure
    Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
    Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
    Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
    Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

Computer Vision
Main Tasks
    Image Classification - cars, cylces, treess
    Object detection - from a dynamic video source for example
    Semantic Segmentation - individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong
    Image Analysis - a person walking with a dog
    Face detection analysis and recognition - 
    OCR

Computer vision services in Microsoft Azure
Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.
